Comment: The orig tarball is repacked because upstream contains a deps/
 directory which bundles snappy and leveldb. On Debian systems we always
 link against system libraries so we avoid these bundled dependencies
 altogether and end up with an orig tarball that is smaller and has no
 lintian warnings.
